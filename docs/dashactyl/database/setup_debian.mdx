This guide is based off of the MongoDB install guide. If you have the `mongodb` package already installed, you can move on to the configuration, as the `mongodb-org` package will cause conflicts.

## Preparation

### Install Dependencies

Install `gnupg`, `curl`, if you already have them both installed, you can skip this step.

```bash
sudo apt install gnupg curl
```

### Import GPG Key

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-5.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-5.0.gpg \
   --dearmor
```

### Create List File

Create a .list file with the following command:

```bash
echo "deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-5.0.gpg ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian bullseye/mongodb-org/5.0 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list
```

## Install MongoDB

Now, all you need to do is update & install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mongodb-org
```

**See: [MongoDB Configuration](./configuration)**
