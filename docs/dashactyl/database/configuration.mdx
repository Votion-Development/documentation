# Configuration

## MongoDB Root Account

First, you'll want to create a root account for you to manage the MongoDB instance.

:::danger
**DO NOT USE IT AS YOUR DATABASE USER FOR DASHACTYL!!!**
:::

```js title="$ mongosh"
use admin

//Do not use this user as your database user for Dashactyl.
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "root",
    pwd: "pwd",
    roles: [ "root" ],
  }
)
```

## Enable Authentication

To make authentication required on login now, you can edit the config file at `/etc/mongod.conf`

### Network settings

Scroll down and find `#network interfaces`

Then, you'll want to replace that whole part with this:

```yml title="/etc/mongod.conf"
# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 0.0.0.0
```

### Security settings

To enable authentication, scroll down until you find `#security:`

Then, you will want to replace it with this:

```yml title="/etc/mongod.conf"
security:
  authorization: "enabled"
```

After all of that, you'll want to restart your MongoDB instance.

```bash
systemctl restart mongod
```

## Create Dashactyl Account & Database

You will want to go back into `mongosh`, authenticate, and then create a database and user with the following:

```js title="$ mongosh"
db.auth("root", passwordPrompt())

//create dashactyl database
use dashactyl

db.createUser(
  {
    user: "dashactyl",
    pwd: "pwd",
    roles: [ "dbOwner" ],
  }
)
```

## Construct MongoDB URI

:::warning
Do not include the DB in the URI, you specify the URI and then the database in the config.
:::

```
mongodb://[user]:[pass]@[host]:[port]/?authSource=dashactyl
```
