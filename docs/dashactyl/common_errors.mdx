# Common Errors

This is a list of common errors you might come across when using Dashactyl.


## Arch Error

![arch_error](/img/arch_error.png)

This error sometimes appears when you try and install the NPM packages. A workaround is to do `npm i -f` instead.

## MongoClient error

If you are getting the error: `MongoClient must be connected`, a simple workaround is by using the non srv connection uri which you can get by choosing an older driver version like `2.2.12` on MongoDB Atlas, or just converting it yourself.


Thank you to Acktar#6724 on discord for the above 2 answers.

## Invalid oauth2 redirect_uri

The reason you are getting `invalid oauth2 redirect_uri` is because you haven't set the `application_url` key in the settings collection in the database, or it is not set correctly. It MUST be set like the following below. __Make sure there is not a trailing `/` at the end!__

```yaml
application_url: "http://panel.example.com"
```
