## Installing NVM

First, we'll want to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to help us install and manage NodeJS versions.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Installing NodeJS & Yarn

### Installing NodeJS

To install the latest LTS version of NodeJS, you can do the following:

```bash
nvm install --lts --default --latest-npm
```
### Installing Yarn & Dependencies

To install Yarn:

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

You can then install the dependencies for Dashactyl by doing the following:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Process Management

We suggest you use a tool called PM2 to keep Dashactyl running constantly.

### Installation

```bash
npm i -g pm2
```

### Starting Dashactyl

You can start Dashactyl by doing the following:

```bash
pm2 start index.js --name dashactyl
```

### Automatic Startup

If you want Dashactyl to start on your server startup, you can do the following:

```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

Then Dashactyl should be able to start on server startup.

## Configuration
